===========================

Marketplace App
	3 types of users:
		Visitors can:
			view sellers
			view items
			(view items by seller)
		Buyers can:
			(All above, and)
			buy items using metamask
		Sellers can:
			(all the above, and)
			register item for sale

Frontend:
	Visitors are people without Metamask linked
	Buyers are people with metamask linked
	Sellers only need an address, so they could be visitors that choose to sell





TODO as of sept 18th:

	Styling: 
		Store page:
			- Fix ItemPreviews are squished from sides
		Notifications:
			- Find better location for notifications??
			- Center notifications like the Create Notification button
			- ("Create Notification" text color lighten, button styling? )
		Browse:
			- Fix wide item when it is alone on the row
		Create: (DONE)
			- Lighten label text color
	
	Optimizations:
		Create / Details / Store pages:
			- Make sure they do not render until they are needed, so the JS doesn't get loaded eagerly
			- How to do this? it might already...
	Testing:
		Test Delete, Purchase, some more: 
			- should close details page when done

	UX: (DONE)
		Browse / ItemPreview:
			- stop showing error-state as items load;
